A port of the Miryoku layout into [Keymap Editor](https://github.com/nickcoutsos/keymap-editor) for the Lily58.

I wanted to be able to make changes to the layout in the future without having to do it via [Miryoku Babel](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku_babel) as I have zero coding experience. 

Thanks. : )
