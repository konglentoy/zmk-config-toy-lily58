A port of the Miryoku layout into [Keymap Editor](https://github.com/nickcoutsos/keymap-editor) for the Lily58.

I wanted to be able to make changes to the layout in the future without having to do it via [Miryoku Babel](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku_babel) as I have zero coding experience. 

Please do keep in mind that this is meant specifically for the Lily58 Wireless from [Typeractive](https://typeractive.xyz/) which uses ZMK. I have no clue how this translates to any other Lily58.

Thanks. : )
